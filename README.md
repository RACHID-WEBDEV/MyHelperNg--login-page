## **Project Description**
This is a web application that links potential volunteers with communities and/or organizations that need them. Especially as exacerbated by the pandemic, it is clear that there’s a need for more volunteers and what this App hopes to achieve is link people willing to render their services, to communities or organizations (NGOs) that need them. So it matches people, based on their expertise and locations to communities or organizations where they’re needed most in a volunteering capacity. MyHelperNG will build the largest repository of volunteers at any given time in Nigeria. Value the Project Offers: This application will connect communities/individuals to organizations providing reliefs. It’ll also provide easy access to information on volunteers and communities that needs help across Nigeria.
